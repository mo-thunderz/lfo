# LFO
LFO for Arduino Due (and other Arduino/Teensy/exp32/etc). LFO can be free-running, or synced to a master-clock.

Youtube video will follow soon

# Installation
1) Make a new folder called "lfo" in your arduino libraries folder
2) Copy lfo.cpp and lfo.h into the "lfo" folder

# How to use
Please refer to the LFO_example.ino file in the examples folder. This file is written for the Arduino Due and can be run on other Arduino boards with some small modifications. I used the Due as it has a built-in DAC.

Have fun ;-)
